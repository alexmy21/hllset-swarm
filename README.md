# hllset-swarm
HLLSet-Swarm turns the mathematical duality between (a) relational algebra of Chinese-character HLLSets and (b) Particle-Swarm Optimisation dynamics into a declarative GPU kernel compiler that lets you script how a 80 k-dimensional “semantic swarm” should move, converge and write its final state back to any external system as live feedback.
